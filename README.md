# TypeScript Redux Portfolio

This project was initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), however it was modified to use both TypeScript and React Redux. Redux was mainly used for maintaining the state of the *previous works* fetched via GitHub API calls and other visual state changes that occur alongside this.
